                        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                            We've all been thereâ€”faced with a dense report, a lengthy research paper, or a mountain of documents and not enough time to read them all. The 'Too Long; Didn't Read' (TL;DR) shorthand isn't a sign of laziness; it's a cry for efficiency. Manually summarizing text is slow, prone to error, and often misses crucial details. This bottleneck prevents us from being as informed and productive as we could be.
